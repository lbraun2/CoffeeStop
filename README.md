# CoffeeStop
SWE 432 project
Ellen Nkonya and Laura Braun

4 Baseline Scenarios:

1. **Registration**: A new user who would like their preferences saved may register for an account using an email and password, and the app will make sure that the email address is not in the system and that the password meets basic requirements.

2. **Search**: Users are able to search for coffee shops based on their preferred location. They can search through the search box on the home page and the results will be displayed on a results page. Every time the user enters information, the results will reload under the input box.

3. **Rating Visualization**: Users can get an overview of the ratings of the coffee shops in their search results. They will be displayed in either a D3.js bar chart or a bullet chart allowing you to see the comparison in average reviews of the shops on a standardized scale.

4. **Search Result Details**: In the map or on the search results on the side, the user is able to click on the different locations and view certain details of the shops: ratings, address, hours, etc.


For HW5, the rating Visualization (using d3) was implemented, and the search result details was moved to React (in previous assignment)
