# CoffeeStop
SWE 432 project
Ellen Nkonya and Laura Braun

4 Baseline Scenarios:
•	Registration: A new user who would like their preferences saved may register for an account using an email and password, and the app will make sure that the email address is not in the system and that the password meets basic requirements. After they register their account, they will be able to log in using the information they have provided
•	Search: Users are able to search for coffee shops based on their preferred location, current location, distance, and open/closed. They can search through the search box at the top of the page and there will be a button to add filters based on distance and open and closed times. Every time the user enters information, the results will reload under the input box. 
•	Rating Visualization: Users can get an overview of the ratings of the coffee shops in their search results. They will be displayed in either a D3.js bar chart or a bullet chart allowing you to see the comparison in average reviews of the shops on a standardized scale. The bars or bullets will be labelled with the store name.
•	Search Result Menu Display: Under the search box, the results will be displayed and there will be a link to see the menu. When the link is pressed a pop-up will appear with a pretty version of the menu


We will be implementing Registration and Search for HW3
